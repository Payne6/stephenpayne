            <p>Steve Payne works from a studio based in central Birmingham.</p>
            <p>His work has engaged with most of the traditional subjects of Western European Art, using these as a springboard into bodies of work which meld tradition with a highly personal, sometimes idiosyncratic approach to both image and method.</p>
            <p>An early body of work dealt with the interplay of vehicle and human traffic in the urban landscape, a long series of drawing and paintings on paper heavily influenced by living for three years in Rochdale and a deliberate break from previous work which was more illustrative in character.</p>
            <p>A move to Birmingham and a larger studio led to more ambitious work with greater experimentation in media, methods and materials with the focus on still-life and interiors deploying the domestic environment as a microcosm of a larger consumer-driven society, an ironic survey of the underclass of disposable, throwaway objects and materials.</p>
            <p>Paintings of small, single objects set against a dark ground extended some of these ideas into more ambiguous forms; brooding expressive paintings, subtly ironic and more abstract.</p>
            <p>A return to the studio after a long absence ushered in a series of small narrative paintings, evoking rather than describing events and situations, and deliberately ambiguous as to any fixed interpretation.</p>
            <p>Recent work has focussed on landscape but now more rural, relatively neglected areas of hinterland, featureless, not obviously inhabited, though bearing the traces of human or animal activity; smaller in scale and mostly explored through drawing.</p>
            <p>The website acts as a survey of some of the most significant work outlined above.</p>
