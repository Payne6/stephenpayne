            <p>Steve Payne is an artist based in Kenilworth with a studio in Central Birmingham.</p>
            <p>His work has engaged with most of the traditional subjects of Western European Art, using these as a springboard into bodies of work which meld tradition with a highly personal, sometimes idiosyncratic approach to both image and method.
</p>
            <p>Within the apparent diversity of themes much of the imagery deals with how we engage with our various environments whether on the land, in the city or at home.
</p>
            <p>Recurring preoccupations have included:</p>
            <p>an urban landscape designed to control traffic flow, where car users become a different species from pedestrians in an almost arbitrary distinction of one mode of being human from another</p>
            <p>the domestic environment as a microcosm of a larger consumer-driven society inundated with clutter; a world where the human presence is displaced to the margins by the predatory encroachment of everyday objects; the living room as landfill </p>
            <p>the landscape of farmland, hinterland, tracks and trails; featureless, but bearing traces of human or animal activity
</p>
            <p>the story-telling of early Renaissance painting and the social and political commentaries of some 20th century art
</p>
            <p>a fusion of image and medium
</p>
            <p>drawing as the bedrock: where ideas are generated, tested, defined, refined and reviewed. Often an autonomous practice, creating material with no further purpose, fragmentary, provisional, spontaneous, and suggestive; visual thinking at its most basic and productive.</p>
            <p>Recent exhibitions have included the John Moores Painting Prize 2018, and The Trinity Buoy Wharf Drawing Prize 2018, 2019 and 2021.</p>
            <p>His work is held in public collections including Birmingham City Museum and Art Gallery, Touchstones (Rochdale), and numerous private collections in the UK, Europe, Canada and Australia.</p>
