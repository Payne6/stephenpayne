This is Steve's website. It is supposed to act as a forum for his paintings and previous exhibitions.

At the time of the first push to github the situation is as follows: 1. The basic structure of the site has been set up, with pages linked to each other etc. 2. Due to the fact that Steve is unable to send me usuable images, I have been forced to use images from my phone camera instead. 3. There is no written content other than what I've generated myself to indicate where the actual written content will eventually go. 4. Minimal attention has been paid to the look and feel of the site, other than giving a schematic idea of what will go where. 

At the time of writing, Stephen has still not seen the website.

The material has now been pushed to github. The name of the main page had to be changed to index.html however, and this change has not yet percolated to github, so I'll attempt another push in the hope that this solves the issue, as it did on my practice run.

The website can now be accessed. However, changing the name of the main page to index.html had the side-effect of breaking some of the links to that page on other pages. I have now fixed these links and the website should accordingly be functioning properly going forward.

Stephen has seen the website. Initial response was guardedly positive. I initially tried merging the main page and the paintings page on a separate branch on git, but the results were unsatisfactory so I went back to the main branch. The experiment branch (called something like main_paintings_merge) still exists. 

Subsequently I uploaded all the actual usable photos to the website, upgraded the top banner and sorted out the main page. Still to do: a CV, the about page and the contact page. 

I have uploaded the new version to github, and now we await stephen's response.
