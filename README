This is Steve's website. It is supposed to act as a forum for his paintings and previous exhibitions.

At the time of the first push to github the situation is as follows: 1. The basic structure of the site has been set up, with pages linked to each other etc. 2. Due to the fact that Steve is unable to send me usuable images, I have been forced to use images from my phone camera instead. 3. There is no written content other than what I've generated myself to indicate where the actual written content will eventually go. 4. Minimal attention has been paid to the look and feel of the site, other than giving a schematic idea of what will go where. 

At the time of writing, Stephen has still not seen the website.

The material has now been pushed to github. The name of the main page had to be changed to index.html however, and this change has not yet percolated to github, so I'll attempt another push in the hope that this solves the issue, as it did on my practice run.
