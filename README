This is Steve's website. It is supposed to act as a forum for his paintings and previous exhibitions.

At the time of the first push to github the situation is as follows: 1. The basic structure of the site has been set up, with pages linked to each other etc. 2. Due to the fact that Steve is unable to send me usuable images, I have been forced to use images from my phone camera instead. 3. There is no written content other than what I've generated myself to indicate where the actual written content will eventually go. 4. Minimal attention has been paid to the look and feel of the site, other than giving a schematic idea of what will go where. 

At the time of writing, Stephen has still not seen the website.

The material has now been pushed to github. The name of the main page had to be changed to index.html however, and this change has not yet percolated to github, so I'll attempt another push in the hope that this solves the issue, as it did on my practice run.

The website can now be accessed. However, changing the name of the main page to index.html had the side-effect of breaking some of the links to that page on other pages. I have now fixed these links and the website should accordingly be functioning properly going forward.

Stephen has seen the website. Initial response was guardedly positive. I initially tried merging the main page and the paintings page on a separate branch on git, but the results were unsatisfactory so I went back to the main branch. The experiment branch (called something like main_paintings_merge) still exists. 

Subsequently I uploaded all the actual usable photos to the website, upgraded the top banner and sorted out the main page. Still to do: a CV, the about page and the contact page. 

I have uploaded the new version to github, and now we await stephen's response.

Stephen's responses become increasingly positive. I have now found a good image for the main page (a gallery photo) and put his CV on the CV page. I have added his email address and a copyright disclaimer to the contacts page. I have also added a new batch to the rochdale paintings page. Stephen is apparently in the process of coming up with some material about himself for the about page. 

Some considerations: is the website colourful enough? I think its simplicity plays in its favour, but is it too severe? Also, it would perhaps be better to have a slightly more interactive method of viewing the individual pictures. Scrolling down works fine, but it also looks crude. More selfishly, it also doesn't display what I'm capable of in terms of coding an image carousel. Of course, I do not currently know how to code an image carousel. Having said all that, it's still unclear what the final  array of images will in fact be, so much depends on what else Stephen is able to send over.

I have added Steve's email and a copyright disclaimer to the contact page, and have also added more images to the small narrative and landscape pages. These alterations have not for some reason appeared on github yet, so hopefully another git push will fix this.

On the carousel branch, I have now created an image carousel for the works page. This allows you to flip through the images that were previously spread across the individual exhibition pages. The categories are listed on the left. Javascript allows you to jump straight to the first image in a category by clicking the relevant category name; further js lights up the category corresponding to the picture you're viewing. 

Stephen has seen the changes an approves. He has now sent over a new batch of images to replace the ones currently in use. He has also included the information pertinent to each picture. Along with these he has sent a new CV and a piece of writing for the About section. 

The remaining tasks are now as follows: 1) to get the About section sorted out; 2) to update the CV page; 3) to create a new folder for the images and put the imaages inside it; 4) to ensure that the js already at works applies to the new images as it did to the previous images; 5) to concoct further js to put the correct info next to the correct picture. This last is probably the trickiest remaining job. Probably the best way to do it is to store the pictures and info as an array of objects and every time you move backwards or forwards through the carousel to iterate through the array and select the details pertaining the current slideIndex. This already happens with lighting up the categories, so probably the same array can be beefed up for this purpose.
